    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of meals prepared, and detailed descriptioms of their ingredients help both students and parents amke the right nutritional choces. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirments they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is key. </p>

      <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
      <img src="attendance.jpg" class="list-group-item list-group-item-success col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data. <br> 2. Economics Have you even thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an ed to innacurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteerium, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, as study done bye the Assium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,000 per employee after implimenting automated attendance management systems. <br> 3. Productivity / Efficiency Monotoring and Managing attendance manually can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtimes, and createpayroll manually, free up precious administration time witha an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to autmoatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combines with data accuracy helps in p=optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
